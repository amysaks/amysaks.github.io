 Hi! My name is Amy Saks. I was born in San Diego, California. I attend Canyon Crest Academy (CCA) as a junior. My hobbies include of personal fitness and zumba. I also enjoy shopping and hanging with my friends. My favorite place to go is the beach, and I love to travel. The coolest place I've been to was to South Africa. My whole family is from there and I love spending time with them. In South Africa, I have been to Johanesburg and Cape Town. I hope you enjoy learning more about me on my site!
