           <h2 style="text-align: center;">Why is this my favorite book?</h2>
           
           "My Heart and Other Black Holes" by Jasmine Wang is my favorite book because it is easy to understand and keeps you wanting to read more. The book is not only written beautifully, but portrays a strange connection between two outcasts who share a bizzare bond. I reccomend this book to many teens because it shows how a connection with someone could possibly save your life. I have read this book a few times, and I could read it a few more too.
